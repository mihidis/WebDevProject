# WebDevProject
Personal project for web development practice. I will try to compine front-end, back-end and a small database.

Update log

21/10 :  entry of the basic html and css pages for a simple site. Not many operations available. Most of the headers point to another content on the same page. Page information is random just for showcasing

23/10 : register and login pages added. simple forms for registering and login. database still simple file that for the time just contains some accounts for testing. Encoding for the password and safe handling of logins/logouts/errors (still more handling to be made).
